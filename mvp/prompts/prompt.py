RULES:
- Preserve the text exactly as shown (no corrections, no additions).
- Do not hallucinate content that is not visible.
- Use Markdown syntax consistently (headings, bullet points, and tables).
- If the image contains a table, output it as a Markdown table with correct column alignment.
- If the layout is unclear, prefer plain text over inventing structure.
- Do not wrap the result in code fences.

EXAMPLE (table case):
| Rank | Nation            | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |
|------|-------------------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1    | **Australia** (AUS) | 2    | 1      | 0      | 3     |
| 2    | **Italy** (ITA)     | 1    | 1      | 1      | 3     |
| 3    | **Germany** (EUA)   | 1    | 0      | 1      | 2     |
| 4    | **Soviet Union** (URS) | 1 | 0      | 0      | 1     |

Extract the content now as Markdown."""

1. Extract **all visible text**. Do **not** invent, reorder, or correct content.
2. Tables must be output as **pipe-delimited Markdown tables** only:
   - Preserve original column order and row order.
   - Keep bolding (`**text**`) exactly as in the source.
   - No HTML, no images, no flags, no extra formatting.
3. Headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) must match exactly.
4. Numbers, ranks, and values must **not change**.
5. Use bullet points only if the source is clearly a list; otherwise, preserve as plain text.
6. Wrap page numbers in `<page_number>â€¦</page_number>` only if present.
7. Do not wrap your output in code fences.
8. Do not add extra Markdown syntax beyond what is visible in the image.
